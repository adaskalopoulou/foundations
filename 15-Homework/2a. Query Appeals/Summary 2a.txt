Summary 2

The MuckRock page I got it from:
https://www.muckrock.com/foi/boston-3/6-boston-police-cocaine-use-released-and-reinstated-3254/

One-sentence summary of what the data is: Boston Police Departement drug testing appeals. The format is a pdf that includes text. 

Short description of how I processed/cleaned it: 

- I used kull to extract specific information that appears on the front page. 
- The result was very messy, see: pdfquery.ipynb
- Then I converted the first page of the pdf to a png in order to create a zone file (see page-1.uzn) 
- I used tesseract to convert it to a text file.
- I analysed it using regex: see notebook pdfquery_png.ipynb
