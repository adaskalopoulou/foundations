Summary 2b
(this is a second attempt to use kull with a pdf, without creating a zone file)

The MuckRock page I got it from:
https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/drug-enforcement-administration-2012-budget-2873/

One-sentence summary of what the data is: Drug Enforcement Administration budget. The format is a pdf that includes text and tables. 

Short description of how I processed/cleaned it: 

- I used kull to extract specific information that appears on the front page. 
- I imported the information in the notebook: pdfquery2.ipynb
